# lunch-picker

Slack app that picks a restaurant to eat at.

Right now this is stupid and hard-coded because I mostly did this to have an
excuse to play around with the serverless framework and AWS Lambda.

## Features I want to add

* Integration with Dynamo DB instead of stupid hard-coded shit.
* Ability to add and remove lunch places.
* Possibly a GitHub pages app to serve as an alternate interface.
* Veto lists based on lunch attendees.
